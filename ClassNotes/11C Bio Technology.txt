		Bio Fuels
			Transportation	
				takes 25% of energy demand
				62% of oil consumed
			Electricity
				Single largest use of fuel in the world
				more than 60% of electric powers come from fossile fuels
			BUTTZ
				Electric cars,
				solar panles
				wind power
			Bio vs. Fossil
				Fossil:
					Will run out, not reusable (finite resouce)
					Worse for enviornment (burning and running fossil fuels)
				Bio:
					Not as bad stuffz in it
					Easy to create
					Ussually more expensive

		Video notes:
			Counter argument notes: 
				Title of video - "Seeds if death"
				-May be a bit biased, used aggresive words such as "forcing genes"
				-talks about organ failure and damaging people bodies
				-Considers gmos as "throwing a monkey wrench into the earths ecosystem"
				- "there has not been enough animal testing, human testing, or enviornmental testing of the affect of these transgenic fish"
				-Talks about organic crops being contaminated with the genetically modified genes from crops near by or "down wind"
				-Shits no monsanto or whatever the company is called
					-They were wrong about alot of products that are safe
				-"GMO means God Move Over" XD lol, good one dumb ass
				-"They need another decade or two of research"
				-Most of this is about monsanto making the GMO products for money instead of healthy producs that are safe
					-Monsanto has strait up told people they are in it for making money for their company and organization.
				-Letting other people worry about the health issues, sometimes even the citizens
				-Comitioner of the FDA was an attourney for monsanto
				-"FDA is full of smart people, but with a conflict of interest. They are in it for whats best for them"
				- Its all about profitability
				-A lot of these are religious tho, "we are the children of god"
				-Rats vs different potatoes experiment (gmo, organic, and organic sprayed)

		Copper recovery from mine waters in the medterranean area and 2000 years ago
			Romaans in Rio tinito copper mine in sain- saw blue fluid, found valuable copper metal
			Bacteria found- Thiobactillus Ferrooxidans
				Eats poor quality ore in acidic enviornments , releases copper that is caled in an solution; metal is then serperated out of the solution
			Lower cost than traditional mining 
			Slower than traditional mining
		1947- The role of bacteria in biomining was described
		1950s- copper biomining proved successful
		1960s- the first industrial copper biomining operation
		1980s- First industrial copeer biomining operation
		Currently there are about 40 plants for undustrial use
		Features of Biomining Bacteria
			Single celled organisms (bacteria)
			Chemo-syntheic metabolism (eat minerals)
			utilize carbon dioxide, oxygen from atmospgere
			Require acidic PH
			Most require high temperatures
				Mesophiles (warm/medium temps)
				Thermophilic (hot temps)
				Extremophiles (extremely hot temps)
					This reaction takes place in the cell meembrane of bacteria

		Commecial BioLeaching
			Naturaly is extremely Slower
			Use these to speed up
			Three types
				Slope Leaching
					continuously sprayed with microorganisms
				Heap Leaching
					In big heaps
					Sprayed with bacteria
					They are happy, and productive
				In Situ (In place) Leaching
		Advatages of Bio leaching
			Simple
			Inexpensive
			Employed for collecting metals from waste ore or tailings
			Use to extract expensive metals- not possible by traditional methods
			No poisonous sulfer dioxeide like in smelters
			
		Adv.2 
			Aprox 420000 abandomd mines

		Polarity vs Non-Polarity Molecules
			dermining the polarity
				If on end of a molecule is slightly positive andanother end is slightly negative the molecule is polar.
					ex:
						C02 - non polar
						H2O- polar
				Arrow points towards electronegative atom
			Polar Molecules:
				Dipole moments are asymetrical and dont cancl out
				Molecule has a net dipole moments
				The highly electronegatice oxygen pulls the electrons away from the H = Very Polar! WOWZERZ

		Human Biological Pacemakers:
			Rather than using electronic pacemakers that used batteries they have found
			a way to create pacemaking cardiac cells that ensure the heart beats.
			With old electronic ones there are risks of infection and lack of full autoonomic control
			These genetic version provides more accurate and precise autonomic control.
			THink of what else can be done with gene development!

		Study Guide
			DNA Structure
				Subunits are nucleotides, Made up of nucleotides
					Nucleotide - Base, sugar, phosphate
						Adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine
					nucleotides linked with backbone - covalent
					bases bonded with hydrogen bonds
					Adenine to Thymine
					Guanine to Cytosine
					5 prime to 3 prime on one side
					3 prime to 5 prime on other side
						They are anti-parallel
					DNA polymerase
						Each fragment of new DNA is an ogasaki fragment
			Role of Enzymes involved in DNA replication
				helicase > Splits DNA strand into two, 
				topoisomerase > releaves tention so DNA doesnt break 
				DNA polymerase > Add complimentary bases to DNA strands
				poly - many
				mer - units
				ase - together
				RNA primase > Adds a peice of RNA on the parent dna strnd
				DNA ligase > Links the ogasaki fragments together (like the glue)
				DNA binding proteins > hold two strands apart
				RNase H > gets rid of the primase
				DNA Polymerase Fixes the mistakes
			DNA replication
				Occurs to replicate cells
				Semi-conservative - half is original strand, half is new/daughter.  Conserves half
				Unwinding of double helix, speration by strands by helicase (at replication origin)
				Hydrogen bonds are broken inbetween bases
				syntesis is 5 prime to 3 prime
				RNA primer sythesized on parent dna using RNA primase
				Adds according to complimentary strand - DNA polymerase
				Ligase glues together ogasaki fragments
				RNAse H removes RNA primers
				Complimentart base pairing
			The Genetic Code:
				Composed of mRNA base triplets - 3 code ons code for one protein 
				64 different codeons
				Codeon is going to be on mRNA
				Amino Acid takes anticodeon/complimentary of 
				AUG is the start codeon
				Stop codeons code for the end of the translation
			Advantages and Disadvantes
				gentetic material can be transfered
				one species could use a useful gene frome another
				Transgenic crops/ livestock can be produced
				bacteria/ yeasts can be genetically engineered
				Viruses can invade cells and take over their genetic enzymes
				Viruses cause disease
			RNA vs DNA
				Single vs double stranded
				ribose vs Deoxyribose
				base thymine replaced with uracil in rna
			Roles of mRNA tRNA and ribosomes in translation
				mRNA with genetic code/ codeons
				tRNA with anticodeon
				tRNA with amino acid attatched
				ribosome with two sub units, large and small
				mRNA held by ribosome
				mRNA containts start codeons (AUG)
				tRNA molecule attatches with mRNA on ribosome
				peptide bond forms between amino acides on tRNA molecules
				continues until a stop codeon is reached
				polypeptide is released
			Translation
				Protein synthesis 
				in cytoplasm
			Transcription 
				RNA syntesis

		Do clones occur in Nature
			YES! Plants and bacteria produce genetically identical offspring(asexual reproduction)
			A new individual is generated from a copy of a sincgle cell from the parent organism
		How about Humans and other mammals?
			Identical twins!
			A fertilized egg splits, creating two or more embryos that carry the identical DNA
		Gene cloning 
			Produces coppies of genes or segments of DNA
		Reproductive cloning 
			Produces copies of whole animals
		Therapeautic cloning
			produces embryotic stell cells for experiments aimed at creating tissues to replace injured or diseased tissues 
		Cloning genes involves two DNA fragments 
			1. Gene of interest
			2. Vector (plasmid)
		What is a vector?
			DBA molecule or plasmid virus that carries foreign genes into another cell (bacteria)
		Why bacteria?
			To obtain millions of gene copies for analysis(sequencing) and/or protein expression (drugs)
		Application?
