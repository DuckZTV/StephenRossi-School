				midrange
		Statistic - a characteristic or measure obtained by using the data values from a sample
		Parameter - a characteristic or measure obtained by using all the data values from a specific population
			
			A (CLASS) |  B (FREQUENCY f) | C (MIDPOINT x) | D (f*x)
			5.5 - 10.5         1                  8       ->     8
			10.5 - 15.5        2                  13      ->     26

		Overview
			First- data sets
				Counted occurences and organized them (class, freqency, percent)
					terms: Class, 
					Class Boundry, =/- .5
					class limits, no overlap, equal sizs, mutally exclusive 
					Frequency,  
					Cumulative Frequency, 
					class width, diff between class limits
					class midpoint, lower + upper limit /2
				Graphing:
					Histogram: x axis: class boundaries
							   y axis: freqency
							   
					Ogive: x class boundaries
					       y cumalative freqency
				Lable the graph with a title, and what the x and y axis are.
				
			Next: 
				Mean: 
					sum of the data points and divide by the # of points
	11/15/16
	
		Z-Score or Standard score
			Represents the number of standard deviations that a data value falls above or below the mean
	
					        value-mean
					z= -------------------
					    Standard Deviation
						
					percentile= number below x

		Fundamental Counting Rule	
			Fliping a coin
				2 posibilities 
			rolling a die
				6 posibilities
				
			2x6= total number of poible outcomes
			
		Permutations-	ORDER MATTERS
			(a,b,c) -> abc | bac | cba
					   acb | bca | cab
			
		Combinations- ORDER DOES NOT MATTER
		
		12/12/16
		nCr = n!/(c-r)!r!
		
		nPr = n!/(n-r)!
		
		Factorial- x!: 
			ex.
				5! = 5(5-1)(5-2)(5-3)(5-4)

			Dice
				Strength in numbers
			Notes	
				Mult Rules
					mult rules can be used to find the probability of two or more events that occur in sequence
					The two events hare independant events (die roll and coin flip)
					The outcome of the two do not effect each other
						"if the fact that A occures does not affect the probability of b occuruing"
						When independant, probability of both occuring is 
							P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) 
					When the outcome or occurence of the first even affects the outome of the occurnce of the second even in a way that the probability is changed
						ex: 
							drawing a card from a deck, not replacing it, and then drawing a second card
						when dependant, the porability of both occuring is 
							P(A and B)= P(A) * P(B|A) 
							
								 P(B|A) 
									Has nothing to do with division
									It means: The prob that even b occurs GIVEN that event A already happened

			PRACTICE
				Multinomial Distribution: 
				
												x     x         x                 __________________________
							               n!              1     2         k  	 /**                      **\
							p(x)= -------------------- * p   * P   ... * P    	 \**  Multinomal EQUATION **/
							       x ! * x ! * x ! ...          2         k   	  \________________________/
								    1     2     3
									
							k = final value
					EX 1.  Firearms Laws
						54% more strict
						11% less strict
						1% no opinion
						34% keep the same
							4>2, so it would be multinomial
							
							 x  | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
							--- |----------------
 							p(x)|.54|.11|.34|.01|

							
					
				Binomial Distribution:
												                           ________________________
							                  n!       x    (n-x)         /**                    **\
							p(scenario)=  ---------- * P  * Q             \**  BINOMIAL EQUATION **/
						                   (n-x)!x!                        \______________________/
							
							
				m= E(x-p(x))
				E= sum off all p(x)
			Probability of at least 3 times :( if 10 trials )
					p(3)+P(4)+P(5)....    P(10) 
					
				P(More than 8) = P(9) + P(10)

			Statistic:
				Ways of looking at data mathamaticaly and scientifically
			Descriptive stats:
				descripe whats going on in a certain population
			Inferential stats: 
				Making predictions for diferent populations 
					ex. high school kids in america from a test on our school
					how people may vote in the future
			variable: characteristic or attribute that can assume different values
				Qualitative - descrive
				Quanitative - numbers
					Discrete - indiviudeal and set (cups of coffee)
					Continuous - values that can flow into another value (time)
			Population: subjects(of any kind) that are being studdied
			sample: group of subjects selected from a population
			Levels of measurement
				Nominal - non numeric
					Names
				Ordinal   - non numeric
					Names With ranking (high, higher, highest)
				Interval -numeric
					Has no zero
				Ratio
					Has a zero
			Random
				Pick stuff outa hat
			systematic
				Every (3rd) person (a formula)
			stratified
				group them, then pick randomly from a group
			cluster
				make grouos then use formula for every so often
			Confounding Variable :
				one that influences te dependant outcome or outcome variable  but was not seperated from the indpendant variable
				
			Histogram:
			freqency polygons
			Ogives (cumalative)
			
			Mean 
			Median
			Mode 
			Midrange
			
			Z-Score- How many standard deviations it is above or below the mean (xfuncion + or - the mean of the graph)
			percentiles	-position in hundeds that a data value holds in the distribution
			Quartiles-poitions in fourths
			Deciles-position in tenths
			
			Outlier is an extremely high or low var. WAY OUT OF THE WAY
			
			probability experiment is a chance process that leads to well-defined results called outcomes.
			outcome is the result of a single trial
			sample spae is the set of all possible outcomes of a porability experiment
			
			Events: consists of a set of outcomes of a probability experiment
			
			probability rule 1: 
				The prob of any even has to be between 0 and 1
			rule 2:
				If an event cannot occur, its probability is zero(0)
			rule 3: 
				if an event is certain, its probability is one(1)
				
			For at least one:
				1 - the probaity of failure
				
			Counting Rule: 
				
				
			independant:
				P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
			Dependant 
				P(a and b) = P(A) * P(A|B)
				
			Counting Rules:
				Fundemetal rule: the sequence of n events in which the first one has k1 possibilities, the second even has k2, and so forth. The total number of possibilities 
				will be  k1 * k2 * k3 ....  Kn
				
				flip a coin, then roll a die, and roll another die
						2 * 6 * 6 = 72
			Permutations- oder matters
						    n!
					P = ---------
				   n r 	 (n-r)!
				**EXAMPLE:    
			5 balls diff numbers- take 3 out at a time (all the different ways you can pick out 3 and oder matters)
				(1) (2) (3) (4) (5)
			
			n=5
			r=3                5!         5*4*3*2!
					 P  =  -------  ->   ---------    -> 5*4*3
					5 3		   2!			2!
					
			Combinations- Order doesnt matter
				The number of cominations of r objects selected from n objects is denoted by nCr and is given by the formula
				
						n!
				C = -------------
			   n r    (n-r)!r!
			  EXAMPLE**
						5!               5*4*3!            5*4! 
				C = -----------   ->  ----------   ->  ----------  -> 5*2! = 10
			   5 3    (5-3)!3!           3!2!				2!
			   
			   Note- less than permutations
			   
		Rules of prob distribution
				1. the sum of the the probabilities of events in the sample must equal 1
				
		central tendency
				Formula for the mean of probability Distribution
					u=X  * P(x ) X * P(x ) ...... Xn * P(Xn)
					   1      1   2     2 
					   
					 where x1 are the outcomes and px are the corresponding probabilities
		Variance
			Ammount the data points are spread out
				 2     2            2
				o = E[X  * P(X)] - u
				
				the standard deviations is 
					      ____
					o=  \/ 
					
		Expected Value: 
			ofa  descrete random variable of a probability distribution is the theoretical average of the variable. The formula is
				u = E(X) = EX * P(X)
			the symbol E(X) is used for expected value
		
		Binomial Distributions
			Variable you are measuring only has two possiblities. Win or Lose. Heads or Tails.
			  n!          n-x    x
			---------- * p    * q
			 n-x! x!
			 
		Fundamental Counting Rule 
				The total number of posibilities will be :
					k * k * k * k  ... *k
					 1   2   3   4       n
