		<h1>Websites Overview</h1>
			
				<div class="textz"> 
					<h2> Google.com </h2>
						<ul> 
							<li> Google "search", "I" bar, and the search hover text. </li>
								<dl>Google is a very user friendly and easy site to navigate. There isnt much on the page other than the search bar, and the search buttons, and as soon as you type one character results start to pop up. This is very well set up and can be easily recognized as a search engine or a tool used to search the internet. </dl>
				</div>
				
				<div class="textz"> 
					<h2> Slack.com </h2>
						<ul> 
							<li> On the homepage it starts off by displaying, "A messaging app for teams who are changing the world!", everything else requires clicking about and signing up. </li>
								<dl>The slack homepage is a little more difficult if someone knew nothing about the internet or websites, but is with some mindless clicking from someone who has been online before they can figure out slack is used for and set up a team/account relatively quicly and easily. If you click off the the "Product" button it will bring you to a tour video and side info that is very helpful and makes using the website for the first time and figuring it out much easier.  </dl>		
				</div>
				
				<div class="textz"> 
					<h2> Alibaba.com </h2>
						<ul> 
							<li> Right off the bat there is, "The Worldâ€™s Leading Platform for Global Trade" in bold and tens of references to producs, order management, and there are many categies/types of products listed.</li>
								<dl> If one stumbled across this page it would not take long to figure out what they should be doing. All over the page it references shopping and online orders, and the search bar is very obvious with a helpful side scrollbar to help, and that is only talking about part of the homepage.  </dl>
